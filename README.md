# Pokemon Cafe

This was a project I built with a group of classmates in my mobile devices class. The app is called Pokemon Cafe and it is a mobile ordering app similar to the starbucks or tim hortonts app except with a pokemon theme twist! The app has a ton of interactive features built in that gamify the ordering experience to keep user engaged and ordering more coffee! 

Each user will start with a pokemon and as they make orders through the app they will gain xp that will go towards leveling their pokemon and earn badges to be able to show off to their friends. 

The app was built in flutter/dart over the course of a semester and I had a hand in the development of various different features like 

1. Setting up the firebase database and designing the schema for our user and menu data 
2. Designed and implemented the badge system so that users could unlock and showcase the badges they have earned by gaining xp from orders 
3. Designed the UI for the User page where users can see and change their profile information as well as see their pokemon and badges earned 
4. Added functionality for camera module so users can take photos and change their profile picutre 
5. Created the login/create account page and implemented all the required functionality
